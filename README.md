### RAG With Gemma

This is an app that takes an input, a pdf and a query, and generates answer for the query based on the input in the pdf.

The structure of the app is as follows:
1. Backend -> Fastapi
2. Frontend -> Vue.js

The app is dockerized. I have created 2 separated containers for frontend and backend and orchestrated them using docker-compose.yaml file. 
In order to run the application:
1. git clone
